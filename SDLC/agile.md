# Agile Model

- It is an approach of software development approach that focuses on timebox based iterative development, flexibility and customer collaboration.

- Agile allows teams to work in small, incremental cycles called sprints(typically 1-4 weeks).

## Phases of Agile Development

1. Concept - Stakeholders and product owners work together to establish the project's goals and scope.
2. Inception - Founder assigns positions or Form Agile team(Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers).
   - Create initial backlog and prioritize features.
   - Plan iteration (Sprint).
3. Iteration/Construction - Develop product in short, time-boxed iterations(Sprints).
   - Daily stand-ups, continuous feedback, and adaptation.
   - Deliver working increments at the end of each Sprint.
4. Release for Testing - Finalize product features and conduct testing.
   - Prepare for deployment (documentation, training, etc.).
5. Production - Releases the program to an on-premises server or the cloud when it's ready for public release.
6. Review - Monitor product performance and user feedback.
   - Archive data and document lessons learned.

## Popular Agile Methodologies

### Scrum

- Scrum is a structured framework that organizes work into time-boxed iterations called Sprints.

#### Scrum Workflow

- Product Backlog → List of all required features.

- Sprint Planning → Select tasks for the Sprint.

- Sprint Execution → Development & Daily Stand-ups.

- Sprint Review → Show completed work.

- Sprint Retrospective → Identify improvements for the next Sprint.

### Kanban

- Kanban is a visual workflow management system that tracks tasks using a Kanban Board. Unlike Scrum, it does not use fixed sprints and allows for continuous delivery.

#### Kanban Workflow

- New tasks are added to the board.

- Team members pull tasks when they have capacity.

- Tasks move from "To-Do" → "In Progress" → "Done".

- Work is continuously delivered without waiting for a sprint to end.
