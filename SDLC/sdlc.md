# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
 **SDLC is a structured process for developing high-quality software efficiently and cost-effectively.
 It defines a systematic approach to software development, ensuring that the final product meets customer requirements.**
## Key Phases of SDLC:
**1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis**
- Stakeholders define software expectations.
- Business Analysts and Project Managers gather requirements through meetings, surveys, and documentation.
- Output: Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.

**2. Planning**
- Project scope, budget, resources, and timelines are determined.
- Risk analysis and feasibility studies are conducted.
- Output: Project Plan.
  
**3. Design**
- Software architecture, UI/UX, database, and system components are planned.
- High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) documents are created.
- Output: Design Document.
  
**4. Implementation (Coding)**
- Developers write code according to design specifications.
- Best coding practices, version control (Git), and code reviews are followed.
- Output: Source Code.
  
**5. Testing**
- Software is tested for defects and performance issues.
- Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) are performed.
- Output: Test Reports and Bug Reports.
  
**6. Deployment**
- Software is deployed in a production environment.
- Deployment strategies: Blue-Green Deployment, Canary Deployment, etc.
- Output: Live System.
  
**7. Maintenance**
- Software updates, bug fixes, and enhancements are made.
- Types of maintenance: Corrective, Adaptive, Preventive, and Perfective.
- Output: Updated Software Versions.
  
## Popular SDLC Models:

**1. Waterfall Model**
- Sequential, phase-by-phase approach.
- Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements.
- Disadvantage: No flexibility for changes.

**2. V-Model (Validation & Verification Model)**
- Testing is done in parallel with development.
- Ensures early defect detection.
- Disadvantage: Rigid structure, difficult to adapt to requirement changes.

**3. Iterative Model**
- Software is developed in repeated cycles.
- Each iteration refines and enhances the product.
- Disadvantage: Requires good initial planning.

**4. Agile Model**
- Incremental and iterative approach.
- Frequent deliveries in small sprints.
- Promotes adaptability and customer collaboration.
- Example: Scrum, Kanban.

**5. Spiral Model**
- Combines iterative development with risk assessment.
- Suitable for complex and high-risk projects.
- Disadvantage: High cost due to continuous evaluation.
  
**6. Big Bang Model**
- No formal planning; everything is implemented at once.
- Suitable for small projects or startups.
- Disadvantage: High risk and unpredictability.
